<H3>Ancient Egytion Writing</H3>
<h6>
Ancient Egyptian writing is known as hieroglyphics ('sacred carvings') and developed at some point prior to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150 -2613 BCE). According to some scholars, the concept of the written word was first developed in Mesopotamia and came to Egypt through trade.

<ol class="c">
<li>All the stars are white actually, even our own Sun. We see them colored because their rays are refracted in the atmosphere before reaching our eyes.</li>
<li>Red dwarfs are the longest-living stars in the Universe. According to scientists, their lifespan can reach tens of trillions of years. For comparison, the age of the Universe is estimated at 13.799 billion years, which is hundreds of times less.</li>
<li>Stars have atmospheres, just like planets. Our Sunâ€™s atmosphere extends the boundaries of the outer Solar System.</li>
<li>The average density of a neutron star is approximately equal to the density of the atomic nucleus.</li>
<li>Stars of our Galaxy orbit around a supermassive black hole at its center just as planets orbit those stars.</li>
<li>There are about as many binary systems in the observable part of the Universe as there are single-star systems.</li>
<li>People combined well-visible stars into constellations, of which there are 88 in the sky. But in fact, these stars can be very far apart and do not interact with each other in any way. Just when viewed from the Ground, the observer seems that they are located next to each other.</li></ol>
